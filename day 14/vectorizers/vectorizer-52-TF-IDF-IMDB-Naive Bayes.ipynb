       "      <td>Set in South Africa, a young black guy tries to land a part in a 'gangsta' movie. But with no knowledge of street life, he's told to find out what that life is really like or he won't get the part. He manages to work his way into a gang led by an old friend of his from school and his chances of appearing in the film decline as he commits crimes to be accepted. But for the gang's leader, the burgeoning disaster of his new friend's life suggests a golden opportunity to do something better with his own.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While that may sound relatively interesting, it's anything but. The first half of it is incredibly meandering and tedious, while the \"hijacking\" only takes place towards the end with some very poorly executed low speed car chases. In those \"chases\", only two police cars are used, both of which are early 90's Nissan Sunny's. Not only would these be rather cheap to pick up (and I find it rather hard to believe they'd be using such mundane old cars in South Africa in the year 2000), but as far as I can remember, there's only 2 involved and none of them get a scratch once. The car chases are very badly shot, with distant and badly timed camera angles and minimal traffic on the roads, and they're all over in around 2 minutes at maximum as you're supposed to believe that a very small kid is actually a highly skilled driver who can easily evade the police despite the driving being pedestrian and utterly unexciting. This now leads me onto the characters and the acting, which are equally bad. The aforementioned kid who drives the car, looks about 13 years old and supposedly is extremely skilled at losing the incredibly inept police. Everybody else is equally unconvincing, so much that they even look bored at times themselves.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At the closing scene of the movie, our main character (\"Sox Moraka\") is asked by the gang leader to steal a car from a car park. While having trouble opening it, the Police arrive and ask him what he's doing and he replies by telling him it's their car. After a brief argument they try to arrest him and he then holds the Police at gunpoint and jumps back in their car. After he's in, the Police return fire and in turn he gets wounded. After another pathetic chase sequence, they decide to abandon the car and set it alight to destroy any evidence. What follows here is one of the most downright laughable and hideously awful special effects I've ever seen. When the car \"explodes\", superimposed flames suddenly appear from every window with awful sound effects that aren't even in time. It's so badly done and so phony looking that it's hard to even put it into words, and really needs to be seen to be believed. If you watch it in slow motion it looks even funnier. I've seen better effects than this in murder reconstruction documentaries. The car is a Volkswagen Golf MK2 GTi. Something that wouldn't be worth a huge amount at all, and they seriously couldn't afford to destroy it with a real explosion? I'd love to know how large the budget for this movie was. It feels so cheap that I'm surprised it made it outside of South Africa, and even more surprised it made it to a DVD release.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I know it's not a big budget Hollywood production. I know it's meant to depict gangs in impoverished townships of South Africa who steal cars from the middle class in and sell the parts on the black market, but with the laughable effects, poorly executed car chases, awful acting and ludicrous characters, any sense of reality is completely lost.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I most certainly do NOT advise you to watch this. If you want to have a laugh and see one of the most poorly done, low budget messes of amovie ever created, then I'd recommend it for that, and only that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is a wretched, poorly made, poorly edited, poorly paced and tedious piece of low budget drivel that fails on all counts. I've seen many South African movies, including lots of cheap NuImage/Nu-World action pictures, and despite their cheesiness, they're far better than this on all counts.</td>\n",

Dear David (from Beligium), why did you bother to write a comment on this movie? I only think we can think about you (after reading you comment), is that you're provably a non-sexual person (like Erika in the movie), and you are not ready for the new cinema that is coming up. I guess you are a bit old, and sexual expression is not part of your \"visage\". The Cannes Film Festival is by far the best movie festival, and I'm is my pleasure to say, that this film was awarded with: Best Actress, Best Actor and Grand Prix. Isabelle Huppert is magnificent, as always, who would do this movie like her? One of her best performances ever. The music is fantastic, and once more Michael Haneke puts reality in the big screen. It's like a Dogma95 kind of movie, because of the topic. Try to see it.<br /><br />   \n",

I was debating between that and mission impossible...I am very glad I choose OSS 117 not only because it was funny but might as well watch a FRench movie while in France. I had a great time... would recommend it. It is important to have some understanding the French society of Today to really enjoy the humor of this movie ... cannot wait for the DVD to come out... I don't know how some of the 'jeu De mots' 'puns' would be translated in English I 'll certainly buy it when it is out! P.S. I saw on 'BRice de Nice' which is a movie starring Dujardin that all kids were talking about in France. this movie is a comedy but sillier than one can imagine...in comparing both movies I have to say that Dujardin did a good job in OSS 117.   \n",
       "15483  Set in South Africa, a young black guy tries to land a part in a 'gangsta' movie. But with no knowledge of street life, he's told to find out what that life is really like or he won't get the part. He manages to work his way into a gang led by an old friend of his from school and his chances of appearing in the film decline as he commits crimes to be accepted. But for the gang's leader, the burgeoning disaster of his new friend's life suggests a golden opportunity to do something better with his own.<br /><br />While that may sound relatively interesting, it's anything but. The first half of it is incredibly meandering and tedious, while the \"hijacking\" only takes place towards the end with some very poorly executed low speed car chases. In those \"chases\", only two police cars are used, both of which are early 90's Nissan Sunny's. Not only would these be rather cheap to pick up (and I find it rather hard to believe they'd be using such mundane old cars in South Africa in the year 2000), but as far as I can remember, there's only 2 involved and none of them get a scratch once. The car chases are very badly shot, with distant and badly timed camera angles and minimal traffic on the roads, and they're all over in around 2 minutes at maximum as you're supposed to believe that a very small kid is actually a highly skilled driver who can easily evade the police despite the driving being pedestrian and utterly unexciting. This now leads me onto the characters and the acting, which are equally bad. The aforementioned kid who drives the car, looks about 13 years old and supposedly is extremely skilled at losing the incredibly inept police. Everybody else is equally unconvincing, so much that they even look bored at times themselves.<br /><br />At the closing scene of the movie, our main character (\"Sox Moraka\") is asked by the gang leader to steal a car from a car park. While having trouble opening it, the Police arrive and ask him what he's doing and he replies by telling him it's their car. After a brief argument they try to arrest him and he then holds the Police at gunpoint and jumps back in their car. After he's in, the Police return fire and in turn he gets wounded. After another pathetic chase sequence, they decide to abandon the car and set it alight to destroy any evidence. What follows here is one of the most downright laughable and hideously awful special effects I've ever seen. When the car \"explodes\", superimposed flames suddenly appear from every window with awful sound effects that aren't even in time. It's so badly done and so phony looking that it's hard to even put it into words, and really needs to be seen to be believed. If you watch it in slow motion it looks even funnier. I've seen better effects than this in murder reconstruction documentaries. The car is a Volkswagen Golf MK2 GTi. Something that wouldn't be worth a huge amount at all, and they seriously couldn't afford to destroy it with a real explosion? I'd love to know how large the budget for this movie was. It feels so cheap that I'm surprised it made it outside of South Africa, and even more surprised it made it to a DVD release.<br /><br />I know it's not a big budget Hollywood production. I know it's meant to depict gangs in impoverished townships of South Africa who steal cars from the middle class in and sell the parts on the black market, but with the laughable effects, poorly executed car chases, awful acting and ludicrous characters, any sense of reality is completely lost.<br /><br />Overall, I most certainly do NOT advise you to watch this. If you want to have a laugh and see one of the most poorly done, low budget messes of amovie ever created, then I'd recommend it for that, and only that.<br /><br />It is a wretched, poorly made, poorly edited, poorly paced and tedious piece of low budget drivel that fails on all counts. I've seen many South African movies, including lots of cheap NuImage/Nu-World action pictures, and despite their cheesiness, they're far better than this on all counts.   \n",

Dear David (from Beligium), why did you bother to write a comment on this movie? I only think we can think about you (after reading you comment), is that you are provably a non-sexual person (like Erika in the movie), and you are not ready for the new cinema that is coming up. I guess you are a bit old, and sexual expression is not part of your \"visage\". The Cannes Film Festival is by far the best movie festival, and I am is my pleasure to say, that this film was awarded with: Best Actress, Best Actor and Grand Prix. Isabelle Huppert is magnificent, as always, who would do this movie like her? One of her best performances ever. The music is fantastic, and once more Michael Haneke puts reality in the big screen. It is like a Dogma95 kind of movie, because of the topic. Try to see it.<br /><br />   \n",

I was debating between that and mission impossible...I am very glad I choose OSS 117 not only because it was funny but might as well watch a FRench movie while in France. I had a great time... would recommend it. It is important to have some understanding the French society of Today to really enjoy the humor of this movie ... cannot wait for the DVD to come out... I do not know how some of the 'jeu De mots' 'puns' would be translated in English I  will certainly buy it when it is out! P.S. I saw on 'BRice de Nice' which is a movie starring Dujardin that all kids were talking about in France. this movie is a comedy but sillier than one can imagine...in comparing both movies I have to say that Dujardin did a good job in OSS 117.   \n",
       "15483  Set in South Africa, a young black guy tries to land a part in a 'gangsta' movie. But with no knowledge of street life, he is told to find out what that life is really like or he will not get the part. He manages to work his way into a gang led by an old friend of his from school and his chances of appearing in the film decline as he commits crimes to be accepted. But for the gang's leader, the burgeoning disaster of his new friend's life suggests a golden opportunity to do something better with his own.<br /><br />While that may sound relatively interesting, it is anything but. The first half of it is incredibly meandering and tedious, while the \"hijacking\" only takes place towards the end with some very poorly executed low speed car chases. In those \"chases\", only two police cars are used, both of which are early 90's Nissan Sunny's. Not only would these be rather cheap to pick up (and I find it rather hard to believe they would be using such mundane old cars in South Africa in the year 2000), but as far as I can remember, there is only 2 involved and none of them get a scratch once. The car chases are very badly shot, with distant and badly timed camera angles and minimal traffic on the roads, and they are all over in around 2 minutes at maximum as you are supposed to believe that a very small kid is actually a highly skilled driver who can easily evade the police despite the driving being pedestrian and utterly unexciting. This now leads me onto the characters and the acting, which are equally bad. The aforementioned kid who drives the car, looks about 13 years old and supposedly is extremely skilled at losing the incredibly inept police. Everybody else is equally unconvincing, so much that they even look bored at times themselves.<br /><br />At the closing scene of the movie, our main character (\"Sox Moraka\") is asked by the gang leader to steal a car from a car park. While having trouble opening it, the Police arrive and ask him what he is doing and he replies by telling him it is their car. After a brief argument they try to arrest him and he then holds the Police at gunpoint and jumps back in their car. After he is in, the Police return fire and in turn he gets wounded. After another pathetic chase sequence, they decide to abandon the car and set it alight to destroy any evidence. What follows here is one of the most downright laughable and hideously awful special effects I have ever seen. When the car \"explodes\", superimposed flames suddenly appear from every window with awful sound effects that are not even in time. It is so badly done and so phony looking that it is hard to even put it into words, and really needs to be seen to be believed. If you watch it in slow motion it looks even funnier. I have seen better effects than this in murder reconstruction documentaries. The car is a Volkswagen Golf MK2 GTi. Something that would not be worth a huge amount at all, and they seriously could not afford to destroy it with a real explosion? I would love to know how large the budget for this movie was. It feels so cheap that I am surprised it made it outside of South Africa, and even more surprised it made it to a DVD release.<br /><br />I know it is not a big budget Hollywood production. I know it is meant to depict gangs in impoverished townships of South Africa who steal cars from the middle class in and sell the parts on the black market, but with the laughable effects, poorly executed car chases, awful acting and ludicrous characters, any sense of reality is completely lost.<br /><br />Overall, I most certainly do NOT advise you to watch this. If you want to have a laugh and see one of the most poorly done, low budget messes of amovie ever created, then I would recommend it for that, and only that.<br /><br />It is a wretched, poorly made, poorly edited, poorly paced and tedious piece of low budget drivel that fails on all counts. I have seen many South African movies, including lots of cheap NuImage/Nu-World action pictures, and despite their cheesiness, they are far better than this on all counts.   \n",

       "15483  Set in South Africa young black guy tries to land part in gangsta movie But with no knowledge of street life he is told to find out what that life is really like or he will not get the part He manages to work his way into gang led by an old friend of his from school and his chances of appearing in the film decline as he commits crimes to be accepted But for the gang leader the burgeoning disaster of his new friend life suggests golden opportunity to do something better with his own While that may sound relatively interesting it is anything but The first half of it is incredibly meandering and tedious while the hijacking only takes place towards the end with some very poorly executed low speed car chases In those chases only two police cars are used both of which are early Nissan Sunny Not only would these be rather cheap to pick up and find it rather hard to believe they would be using such mundane old cars in South Africa in the year but as far as can remember there is only involved and none of them get scratch once The car chases are very badly shot with distant and badly timed camera angles and minimal traffic on the roads and they are all over in around minutes at maximum as you are supposed to believe that very small kid is actually highly skilled driver who can easily evade the police despite the driving being pedestrian and utterly unexciting This now leads me onto the characters and the acting which are equally bad The aforementioned kid who drives the car looks about years old and supposedly is extremely skilled at losing the incredibly inept police Everybody else is equally unconvincing so much that they even look bored at times themselves At the closing scene of the movie our main character Sox Moraka is asked by the gang leader to steal car from car park While having trouble opening it the Police arrive and ask him what he is doing and he replies by telling him it is their car After brief argument they try to arrest him and he then holds the Police at gunpoint and jumps back in their car After he is in the Police return fire and in turn he gets wounded After another pathetic chase sequence they decide to abandon the car and set it alight to destroy any evidence What follows here is one of the most downright laughable and hideously awful special effects have ever seen When the car explodes superimposed flames suddenly appear from every window with awful sound effects that are not even in time It is so badly done and so phony looking that it is hard to even put it into words and really needs to be seen to be believed If you watch it in slow motion it looks even funnier have seen better effects than this in murder reconstruction documentaries The car is Volkswagen Golf MK GTi Something that would not be worth huge amount at all and they seriously could not afford to destroy it with real explosion would love to know how large the budget for this movie was It feels so cheap that am surprised it made it outside of South Africa and even more surprised it made it to DVD release know it is not big budget Hollywood production know it is meant to depict gangs in impoverished townships of South Africa who steal cars from the middle class in and sell the parts on the black market but with the laughable effects poorly executed car chases awful acting and ludicrous characters any sense of reality is completely lost Overall most certainly do NOT advise you to watch this If you want to have laugh and see one of the most poorly done low budget messes of amovie ever created then would recommend it for that and only that It is wretched poorly made poorly edited poorly paced and tedious piece of low budget drivel that fails on all counts have seen many South African movies including lots of cheap NuImage Nu World action pictures and despite their cheesiness they are far better than this on all counts   "

       "39908    Follows the usual formula in putting new recruit this time the first African American Cuba Gooding after President Truman desegregates the Armed Forces through the YOU Navy deep sea diver training program that is run by racist zealot Robert DeNiro If the program were not bad enough it is got to be located in Bayonne New Jersey There is nothing wrong with the performances Robert De Niro activates his Southern accent and shouts gibberish effectively Cuba Gooding raised by stern father as poor black farm boy in the South is the expectable paragon of rectitude The girls one could hardly call them women are Charleze Theron and Lonette McKee They have minor roles and are mostly there to argue that their men should exercise common sense Other decent performers Powers Boothe and Hal Holbrook have even more perfunctory roles That is about it Almost everything else could have been assembled by computer ship is called boat Robert De Niro salutes indoors uncovered After brutal assault on hospital personnel he is transferred out of his outfit instead of being busted Somebody shouts am outta here in the early Maybe it was common expression at the time If so my bad People address each other by rank Lieutenant Boatswain Mate Commander as they do in the Army whereas in the Navy they are simple Mister if an officer or addressed by their last name if enlisted did not bother to check if there was rank called Senior Master Chief in Cuba Gooding has tough row to hoe Everyone in the Navy it seems hates Negroes except for one guy from Wisconsin He stutters and is held in contempt by the others in his class It is like the scene in Animal House in which the applicant to tony fraternity is asked to wait in room with Sikh black man and blind kid Gooding is an enlisted man second class petty officer He manages to marry beautiful woman who has just graduated from medical school In one of their arguments she pleads with him She just wants to be doctor and he should join her quit the Navy and lead quiet life And just let life pass you by he retorts Yes Yes just be doctor spouse and let life pass you by You can wave to it from the golf course in Boca Raton These kinds of flicks were common enough in World War II Bombardier Airial Gunner that sort of thing Cheap as they often were they had some educational features You learned something about becoming bombardier or gunner Here the technical details are skipped over perhaps because the writer knew nothing about them except Boyle law which we learned in high school chemistry could not follow what was happening during some of the emergencies without which movie like this would not exist If got the mechanical problems right it was because guessed correctly The direction is no help either The movie abounds in close ups so many that they lose any dramatic impact they might have had And the emergencies are confusing because they are ill focused Why go on Want to see better example of this kind of movie Almost any will do except maybe I Jane in which the abused hero is heroin Try the training camp scenes in The Young Lions There the victim is Jew Or try From Here to Eternity in which no easy sympathy buttons are pushed and the victim is grown man who refuses to bend and who is active in bringing the conflict on just like Cool Hand Luke No easy excuses are offered because easy excuses are too easy Thoroughly formulaic and not well done \n",
